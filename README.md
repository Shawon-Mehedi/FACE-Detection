# FACE-Detection
Face Detection Projects with OpenCV
This repository contains two simple yet powerful AI face detection projects using Python and OpenCV.

ðŸ“¸ 1. Face Detection in Static Images
This script loads a static image (Human.jpg), converts it to grayscale, and uses OpenCVâ€™s pretrained Haar Cascade classifier to detect human faces.
It then draws colorful rectangles around each detected face and displays the result in a window.

Main features:
âœ… Uses haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
âœ… Random-color rectangles for each detected face
âœ… Simple image display with OpenCVâ€™s imshow()

ðŸŽ¥ 2. Real-time Face Detection from Webcam or Video
This script activates your webcam (or can be modified to load a video file) and performs real-time face detection on each video frame.
It draws bounding boxes around faces in live video and displays the processed frames continuously until you press Q (q or Q key) to stop.

Main features:
âœ… Works with webcam or pre-recorded videos
âœ… Live face detection on video frames
âœ… Random-color rectangles for fun visual feedback
âœ… Graceful shutdown when key pressed
